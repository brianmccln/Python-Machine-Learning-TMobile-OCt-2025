# Python for Machine Learning Bootcamp - 30 hr course, updated and revised

With START and FINAL files, plus all images and csv files.

Each of 5 days has numbered lessons (01-05):

## Day 01 - Statistical Foundation of Data Science and Machine Learning
- Normal and uniform distribution, bell curve
- Standard deviation
- Plotting linear regression line
- Plotting polynomial regression line
- Grouping data
- Seaborn plotting library

## Day 02 - Machine Learning with Regression Models
- Supervised vs. unsupervised learning
- sklearn machine learning library
- Training vs testing data
- Preprocessing data by:
  - Splitting data into training and testing sets
  - Scaling numeric data (setting mean value to 0)
- **Linear Regression**: Predicting continuous values (prices, quantities)
- **Logistic Regression**: Predicting discrete values (category, yes/no)
- Correlation matrix and correlation heat maps
- Splitting data into training and testing datasets
- Training regression models on training data
- Having regression models make predictions on testing data

### Project Datasets:
- Car Sales
- Employees

## Day 03 - Machine Learning with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier
- KNN: Classifying unknown data according to its "nearest neighbors"
- Making our own KNN dataset from scratch
- Working with sklearn built-in dataset (Iris)
- Multiple scatterplots by class and predicting class of "new dot"
- Splitting Iris data into training and testing datasets
- Training a KNN machine learning model on training data
- Having KNN model make predictions on testing data

### Project Datasets:
- Self-made dataset
- Iris dataset

## Day 04 - Machine Learning with Random Forest Classifier
- Loading Titanic datasets from Kaggle CSV files and from Seaborn
- Exploring dataset and plotting it
- Cleaning the data by dropping columns with too many null values
- Visualizing Titanic survival rate with bar charts
- Training a Random Forest model on Titanic training data
- Testing a Random Forest model on Titanic testing data
